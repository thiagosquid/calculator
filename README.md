# calculator
 A simple calculator write for a challenge.

 I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Trying to make a clean and efficient code.
 
 ## Issues 
 1. Needs to fix the number of decimals because it's making a great number exceding the display
 2. Then to include a option to change themes from calculator
